Three things I'm worried about:
 (1) The client currently won't be able to represent the state correctly in all situations
   (i.e. update the route if the server decides it wants us in another room)
 (2) Extending it later to add:
   - custom nicknames
   - Room settings (category, difficulty, etc)
   - Room creation menu
   - Logging in to save stats and guest mode
 (3) Extending the UI
   - More nested UI options = more complicated representation of state
   - Not too with CSS, so doing it in a way that is scalable and simple is hard

Some of these changes obviously need additions on the server.

To fix problem (1):
 - Have a global listener to the server. When state changes occur (enter game room, leave game room, disconnect), update the route automatically.

To fix problem (2):
 - As the server is expanded to provide these options, new events will need to be added to
   keep track of the state better. It may also be helpful to add a 'join lobby' and/or 'leave lobby'
   event(s) to make keeping track of state a bit easier.

To fix problem (3):
 - No goddamn idea, I suck at angular at the moment
